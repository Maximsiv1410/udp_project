# UDP project
Here is my attempt to implement well-formed, reusable </br>
and effective solution related to SIP and RTP </br>

The most interesting part now is basic_udp_io.hpp </br>

Usage showed in 'client' and 'server' folders

## Dependencies:
* boost::asio

## Building
For this purpose I created simple Makefiles </br>
Just type 'make opt' if you want to try release version </br>
